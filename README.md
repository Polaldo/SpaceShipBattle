## ðŸš€ 2D Unity Game Prototype (PC Demo)

This is a 2D game prototype developed in Unity, originally idea was for mobile but currently im just focusing being playable on PC. The project is designed as a technical showcase of core gameplay systems and modular architecture for use in production-level game development. 
To create this game I was inspired by gacha and rpg games such as Dokkan battle, Archero and more...

### ðŸŽ® Key Features
Modular Level System â€“ Supports structured progression and dynamic content loading.

Mission System â€“ Task-based flow with support for chaining objectives and rewards.

Player Ranking System â€“ Tracks and ranks player performance across missions.

Ability System â€“ Ships have modular, triggerable abilities tied to gameplay states.

Behavior Tree AI â€“ Enemy behavior driven by a custom BT system for flexible design.

Parallax Scrolling â€“ Multi-layer background system for depth and motion.

FMOD Integration â€“ Complete audio system driven by FMOD Studio, enabling reactive sound design and dynamic music. [ðŸŽ§ Click here to go to the repo's FMod ðŸŽ§](https://github.com/Polaldo/SpaceShipBattleAudioSystemFMod)

### ðŸ§ª Tech Stack
Unity (URP) â€“ Core engine used for rendering and 2D gameplay.

C# â€“ Full project written in modular and scalable C# scripts.

FMOD Studio â€“ External tool used for audio design and runtime integration.

ScriptableObjects â€“ Used for defining abilities, missions, and level data.

Coroutines & Event System â€“ Game loop and UI feedback driven through custom event architecture and coroutines.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals
This project was built as a portfolio piece to demonstrate:

Real-time gameplay systems

Code architecture and maintainability

Integration of external tools (FMOD)

UX for PC/mobile hybrid game design


### âš¡Future Possible Features
- Implement a gacha-like system where you can get components for your ship
- Each componet has his own abilities, level and rarity
- Events
- New enemies
- Save system
- Daly login, missions, etc...
- Dialougue sytem to create a story
